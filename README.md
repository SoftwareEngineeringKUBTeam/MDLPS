The Mail Delivery Logging and Processing System is designed to expedite university mail services by allowing them to electronically log packages from a barcode scanner. This system was designed to replace manual booking systems currently in place in some universities with a much simpler system that allows users to easily query the packages archived without searching through possibly hundreds of paper bookings.
